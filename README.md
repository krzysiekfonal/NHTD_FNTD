To launch an example tests, there are 2 launch scripts (used in the paper):
TEST_ht_decomposition.m and TEST_ht_decomposition8.m.
First ine is for tests with 4-order tensor decompositions and second it for 8-order tensor decompositions.

NOTE:
To be able to launch the scripts you need to add 2 toolboxes to your matlab's paths:
-kolda toolbox (https://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.6.html)
-tensorlab (https://www.tensorlab.net/)
